# Test-Time-Augmentation
Augmentation Method
> In image classification, while we are going to predict classes for our test set images after training our model, we will generate the confidence probability for each test image for n number of times and finally we will assign the max average value among all the prediction classes to the image. This is called test time augmentation.
